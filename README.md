	- gradle 6.7  

Instructions:  
	Terminal(cmd, powershell, unix shell, ...):  
		1º change the working directory to the project's root.    
		2º gradle build   
		3ª gradle [run | astar | breathfirst | depthfirst | greedy | uniform | iterative]  
	IntelliJ:  
		1º Click on "Build Project" button or press "Ctrl+F9" to compile the code.  
		2º Clink on "Run App" button or press "Shift+F10" to run the aplication.  

When the Aplication is Running the user can use the available buttons to change the difficulty, request a hint and also show the solution obtained by the algorithm (Hint and Solve buttons may take a while to appear because they are waiting for the algorithm to complete). For a better user experience it is also possible to try to solve the puzzle yourself.
